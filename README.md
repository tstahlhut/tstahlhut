### 👋 Hi there, I’m Tatiana, a student at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/)! 🚀

Coming from the world of spoken languages, I embarked on a steep learning journey into the world of programming, thanks to 42 Berlin! Since August 2022, I’ve been deeply engaged in programming — starting with C, then progressing to C++, and eventually expanding into web development. Along the way, I explored system administration, networking, and more.

You can find almost all the projects I did so far during the 42 Berlin core curriculum in this repository.

💻  Currently working on 'Transcendence' — the final project of the 42 Berlin core curriculum. As a group we are developing a simple, real-time multiplayer version of the classic Pong game, using Node.js for the backend and socket.io for real-time communication between clients - stay tuned 🚀

🔍 What I love:

  - System-level programming
  - Linux
  - Refactoring code (it should already look appealing and structured)
  - Cybersecurity

🔮 What’s Next?

I’m looking to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity and step into the job market — always excited to collaborate on open-source or low-level system projects!
