### ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Tatiana, a student at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/)! ğŸš€

Coming from the world of spoken languages, I embarked on a steep learning journey through the world of programming thanks to 42 Berlin!
Since August 2022, I am programming in C, then evolved to C++ and learned quite some interesting things about system administration and networking.

You can find almost all the projects I did so far during the 42 Berlin core curriculum in this repository.

ğŸ’» Currently I am working on a 42 group project, Webserv, where we build a simple HTTP-Webserver ğŸš€
